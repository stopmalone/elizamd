### What kind of change is this?

5. **Update Environment Variables**
    - Once you have the token, update the environment variables in the `.env` file:
      ```env

      DEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.deva.me # Production API URL
      ```

7. **Run the Application**
    - Execute the following commands to install dependencies and start the application:
      ```bash
      pnpm install && pnpm start
      ```
    - This will initiate the Deva client:

    - Once done, Eliza will post one message to the Deva feed immediately and schedule another one as a test message:
      <br/>![Post Messages](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523d69f4-1f3f-4d49-82a1-163e3cd4d128)

### Staging Environment Testing

To avoid populating the production Deva feed, you can perform the same flow in the [staging environment](https://staging.deva.me/). Ensure you update the related environment variable:

```env
DEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.deva.me # Staging API URL
